                                <li><strong>Natural Archer:</strong> Wood Elves spend their whole lives training with
                                    bows - their arrows are always more deadly.
                                </li>

                                    crouch to gain night vision and become undetectable to nearby mobs.
                                </li>

                                <li><strong>Steward:</strong> Wood elves live off of and in harmony with the forest -

                                    attacks deal reduced damage but are slightly faster.

                                <li><strong>Fragile:</strong> A High Elf is not built for hand to hand combat. They are
                                    much more susceptible to physical damage, and have less health.

                                <li><strong>Mystic Affinity:</strong> High Elves are powerful and clever manipulators of
                                    arcane energy - they deal more magic damage and take less magic damage than other
                                    races.

                                    sneaking, and move a short distance while stealthed. When attacking from stealth,
                                    their first attack deals bonus damage and ends the invisibility. This deals extra

                                    associated with good luck. When mining, they will occasionally get something
                                    valuable from plain stone.

                                    mischievous acts which, if not always dangerous, are certainly loud.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Bitesize:</strong> Pixies are some of the smallest creatures to roam the
                                    land, rarely even reaching the average human's knee.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Soaked:</strong> Being as small as they are, water poses a significant
                                    threat to pixies. It hampers their movement and impairs their ability to fly.

                                <li><strong>Brittle:</strong> The Arachnae's chitinous exoskeleton makes it difficult to
                                    move if wearing armor heavier than iron. This can be prevented with an enchantment.

                                <li><strong>Climber:</strong> The fine bristles on the Arachnae's legs allow them to
